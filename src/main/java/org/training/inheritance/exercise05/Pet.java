public class Pet {
//	You have been given a design document for a veterinary registration system for implementation
//	in Java. It states:
//	
//	¡°A pet has an owner, a registration date, and a vaccination-due date. A cat is a pet that has a
//	flag indicating if it has been neutered, and a textual description of its markings.¡±
//	
//	1) Define class Pet (this class) according to the statement above.
//	2) Given that you expect the Cat class to be used freely
//	throughout the application, how would you make the opening declaration of the Cat class, up
//	to but not including the first opening brace? Use only these words and spaces: boolean, Cat,
//	class, Date, extends, Object, Owner, Pet, private, protected, public, String.
//		A. protected class Cat extends Owner
//		B. public class Cat extends Object
//		C. public class Cat extends Pet
//		D. private class Cat extends Pet
//	Define class Cat in same package but separate file.
